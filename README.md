The following repo contains files that construct two maps using the E-Rate data API from the Scroata API.

## Data
The data was acquired from the [E-rate Request for Discount on Services: Basic Information](https://opendata.usac.org/E-rate/E-rate-Request-for-Discount-on-Services-Basic-Info/9s6i-myen)
dataset. Using the [python script](https://github.com/jeremysingh21/USAC-GIS-TASK/blob/master/USAC_Data.ipynb), the socarata api was accessed to pull the requested data.
## Web Maps
Two web maps were constructed using MapboxGL and Mapbox studio. The maps can be found [here](https://jeremysingh21.github.io/USAC-GIS-TASK/index.html)
